## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @BButner
I currently work as a Software Engineer for Flight Simulation.

My passions with development include creating easy to use and performant systems. When I'm working in the backend I focus on maintainability, reusability, and performance. On the frontend, I ensure my UI + UX is responsive, clean, fast, and intuitive.

If I can make a developers life easier, or a users life easier, its been a good day!

## â˜• My Focus
Currently, I'm focusing on these areas:

- C#
- Rust
- Webdev
